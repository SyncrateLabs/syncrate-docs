# The SYNC Token

The SYNC token is the native utility and governance asset of the Syncrate Protocol. It is designed to coordinate trustless cross-chain settlements and align the interests of liquidity providers, institutional users, and node operators.

***

### SYNC Utilities

* **Transaction Fees:** Every cross-chain RWA settlement requires a small fee (0.1bps. customizable per issuer) paid in either the native chain the user is routing to or in SYNC. This hybrid model reduces transaction frictions.

* **Node Staking:** Operators who validate the state of the cross-chain bridges must stake SYNC. If a node provides false data about a fiat on-ramp status (via the BaaS partner), their stake is slashed.

* **Community Incentives:** A portion of SYNC token is allocated to developers and ecosystems helping to build the Syncrate ecosystem.

* **Fee Abstraction:** Syncrate allows institutions to pay a single fee in SYNC, while the protocol’s backend automatically handles the underlying gas payments on the destination chains using the Syncrate treasury.

* **Governance:** SYNC holders vote on protocol parameters and the deployment of the Syncrate Treasury.
