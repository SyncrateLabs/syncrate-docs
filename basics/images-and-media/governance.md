# Governance Framework

The Syncrate protocol is designed to transition into a decentralized, community-governed ecosystem. Governance is not merely about technical parameters but focuses on the safety, compliance, and integrity of the real-world assets orchestrated by the protocol.

## The SYNC DAO

The SYNC DAO is the primary decision-making body. Token holders stake SYNC to receive veSYNC (Voting Escrow SYNK), which grants the right to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.
