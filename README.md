# Overview

Syncrate is a decentralized routing layer for tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs).

As the RWA ecosystem expands across chains, issuers, and settlement standards, liquidity becomes increasingly fragmented. Most tokenized assets today are permissioned, KYC-gated and legally required to stay and operate on their canonical chain. So if an investor wants to move capital from Asset A to Asset B, they have to manually redeem Asset A, wait for settlemen, bridge and then re-enter the Asset B issuance process. This process is slow, comes with a lot of friction and completely breaks the idea of seamless asset movements.

Instead of creating new tokenization standards or chains, Syncrate provides a unified settlement rail that standardizes how tokenized assets enter, move through, and exit the RWA liquidity landscape. By routing flows through canonical entry and exit points, Syncrate abstracts away fragmentation across issuers, custodial gateways, RWA chains, on-chain issuance platforms, and settlement venues.



## Key Capabilities&#x20;

* &#x20;**Canonical Entry & Exit Routing**

Standardizes how assets flow into and out of the RWA ecosystem, creating predictable, unified settlement pathways across fragmented venues.

* &#x20;**Cross-Venue Settlement Optimization**

Evaluates and executes the most efficient settlement routes across issuers, custodians, RWA chains, and liquidity venues.

* &#x20;**Unified API/SDK for Integrations**

Abstracts away complex, venue-specific integrations, allowing developers to access the full RWA landscape through a single interface.

* **Neutral Meta-Routing Layer**

Operates independently of issuers and protocols, enabling objective routing, improved interoperability, and consistent settlement logic across the ecosystem.



## Who Syncrate Is For

* RWA protocols looking to aggregate external liquidity
* Developers building wallets, institutions, or settlement applications
* Exchanges & brokerages needing optimal paths between tokenized real-world assets
* Enterprises & financial institutions exploring on-chain RWA infrastructure



## Why Syncrate Matters

The RWA market is rapidly moving on-chain, but liquidity, standards, and settlement flows remain isolated. Syncrate creates the routing layer needed for the next wave of RWA applications — making it easier to build, integrate, and scale tokenized asset systems.
