# Overview

Syncrate is a decentralized routing layer for tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs).

As the RWA ecosystem expands across chains, issuers, and settlement standards, liquidity becomes increasingly fragmented. Most tokenized assets today are permissioned, KYC-gated and legally required to stay and operate on their canonical chain. So if an investor wants to move capital from Asset A to Asset B, they have to manually redeem Asset A, wait for settlemen, bridge and then re-enter the Asset B issuance process. This process is slow, comes with a lot of friction and completely breaks the idea of seamless asset movements.

Instead of creating new tokenization standards or chains, Syncrate provides a unified settlement rail that standardizes how tokenized assets enter, move through, and exit the RWA liquidity landscape. By routing flows through canonical entry and exit points, Syncrate abstracts away fragmentation across issuers, custodial gateways, RWA chains, onchain issuance platforms, and settlement venues.

## Who Syncrate Is For

* RWA protocols looking to aggregate external liquidity
* Developers building wallets, institutions, or settlement applications
* Exchanges & brokerages needing optimal paths between tokenized real-world assets
* Enterprises & financial institutions exploring onchain RWA infrastructure

## Why Syncrate Matters

The RWA market is rapidly moving onchain, but liquidity, standards, and settlement flows remain isolated. Syncrate creates the routing layer needed for the next wave of RWA applications — making it easier to build, integrate, and scale tokenized asset systems.
